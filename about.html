                <p class="para1">I am Ernesto Garcia, the co-owner of Tade Painting Services LLC along with my son, Ernesto Jr. I have been painting for over 16 years. I began my painting career in Alabama, where I lived for 9 years, 
                   I adapted quickly and soon became more independent and began my own work. I gained experience over time by first painting a small family room and over time began painting 5000 sq.
                   ft. homes.</br></br>
                    From the very beginning I took pride in my work, I made sure that every single project I was assigned to would exceed the customer’s expectations.
                   Over time i decided it was time for me to build my own crew and began obtaining my own contracts. I instill my mind set of cleanliness, safety, hard-working, and respect onto every one of my crew members.
                   Customer satisfaction is the number one priority to not only me but my entire crew from day one. I want you to look at your house and have no doubt that you made the right choice in choosing Tade.
